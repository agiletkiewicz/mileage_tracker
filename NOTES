Adding another component: RUNS 
    - TABLE RUNS:
        - :shoe_id, :date, :miles_run, :location, :current_mileage?
    - MODELS:
        - runs belong_to shoes, and shoe has_many runs
        Run model specs:
            - validates :shoe_id, :date, :miles_run, :location
    - CONTROLLERSS:
        - gets '/shoes/:id'
            - @runs = current_user.runs
            -(IN VIEWS) display run log in a table by iterating .each_with_index over runs. This will display:
                Date of Run     Miles Run       Location        Current Mileage (@newest_run = (@shoe.current_mileage.to_i + @shoe.latest_run.to_i))
        - get '/shoes/:id/runs'
            - take away date of purchase, max shoe mileage.
            - form inputs for date of run, miles run, location, and show current mileage
