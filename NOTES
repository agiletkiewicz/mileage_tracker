JULY 5:

Add the Flash message bonus in the project requirement

Check ALL requirements and make sure everything is good to go!!! :)




For added security when cloning the repo, generate your own session secret:

1. Comment out the current session_secret in the Application Controller and un-comment the ENV.fetch('SESSION_SECRET').
2. Create a new .env file by running touch .env in your terminal
3. Use the session_secret_generator gem, included in this project's Gemfile, by running generate_secret in the terminal.
4. Copy the secret from your terminal output and paste into your .env file locally. It should look something like this in your .env file:
        SESSION_SECRET=8ad90be1a5a9aaaf04a0a99d8efb42c825f16b8fef603f65b600c91d66a17bdd520099130ed70669409a524a97c8f62e9434a0ad102624f9bcff0832e3c2f568

    NOTE Don't use this secret!!! The secret you use should be kept private and out of version control or anywhere else publicly accessible.
