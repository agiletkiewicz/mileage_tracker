# Sinatra Mileage Tracker

A Sinatra-powered web application used to save and track mileage on running shoes.

This app could be used for:
* Allowing a user to keep track of the mileage on multiple pair(s) of running shoes.
* An advertising/marketing tool for running shoe companies (When a user reaches their maximum mileage, an alert is sent to the user to buy new shoes). 
* Saving user-created names of shoes, and tracking the mileage of their shoes.

This project was created as part of the [Flatiron School's Online Web Developer program](https://flatironschool.com/).
